# Vault

Your Obsidian Markdown vault for AI agents, exposed through one MCP server.

Repository: [alastairgarner/vault](https://github.com/alastairgarner/vault).
The MCP server identifies itself as `vault`; client-side connection labels can also
use Vault. Existing tool names and deployment identifiers are unchanged.

## Intent

Plain Markdown files are authoritative. Reuse [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) for keyword and semantic search rather than building a search engine. Combine retrieval and safe file editing behind one endpoint accessible to agents on the trusted home LAN and Tailscale network.

Target deployment: Docker on a Raspberry Pi; assess ARM64 support and model resource requirements before promising local semantic-search performance. A stronger tailnet host is an option, not a settled decision.

## Proposed first slice

- Discover allowed directories and list notes.
- Search via QMD; return compact excerpts and references.
- Read authoritative files or sections directly from disk.
- Create Markdown notes without overwriting existing files.
- Edit using unique exact old-text/new-text replacements and expected content hashes.
- Enforce allowed-root boundaries, including symlink/traversal protection.
- Serialize writes per file, verify hashes inside that critical section, and use safe atomic replacement.
- Refresh the derived search index after writes and expose pending/stale indexing explicitly.
- Offer stdio for local development and Streamable HTTP for shared access.

V2 requires a named bearer token for every HTTP MCP request. Administrators manually configure token hashes in a private JSON file; all registered clients can read/search and edit existing notes throughout the allowed root, but can create new notes only inside lowercase root-relative `ai/`. Keep access on the trusted LAN/tailnet and use HTTPS through Traefik. See [authentication setup](docs/authentication.md).

## Not settled

Target topology is Raspberry Pi Docker behind the existing Traefik reverse proxy and private DNS, accessible from the trusted LAN/tailnet. V2 token authentication is implemented locally. Semantic models, refresh scaling, and deployment hardening remain open; only local fixture Docker testing is currently authorized/performed.

## Out of scope initially

Kanban UI, task orchestration, repository synchronisation, notifications, and a bespoke vector database/search engine. Tasks and specs can initially be ordinary Markdown conventions.

## Local prototype

TypeScript **7.0.2** (registry `latest` when checked), pnpm **12.14.0**, Node.js **22+**. MCP servers are fully supported by the official TypeScript SDK. Linux with `/proc/self/fd` is currently required for descriptor-anchored filesystem containment.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test

# Local fixtures only; never point these commands at your real vault.
mkdir -p .local/notes/ai
pnpm dev "$PWD/.local/notes" "$PWD/.local/state"
# Or: pnpm build && pnpm start "$PWD/.local/notes" "$PWD/.local/state"
```

The entrypoint speaks MCP over **stdio**, not an interactive shell. For an MCP client, use command `node` with args `["/absolute/project/dist/src/main.js", "/absolute/fixture-notes", "/absolute/private-state"]` after `pnpm build`. Do not use a package-manager wrapper as the MCP command: its progress output may pollute protocol stdout.

- `src/main.ts`: stdio entrypoint; `src/server.ts`: validated MCP tool definitions.
- `src/http-main.ts` / `src/http.ts`: authenticated Streamable HTTP entrypoint and transport lifecycle.
- `src/auth.ts` / `src/token-hash.ts`: manual hash-only credential config, bearer validation, and stdin-only hashing helper.
- `src/brain.ts`: thin QMD SDK integration and serialized operations.
- `src/files.ts`: contained Markdown access and atomic publication; `src/images.ts`: bounded base64/image-signature validation.
- `src/errors.ts`: unknown-error handling; `test/brain.test.ts`: fixture-only integration/safety tests, including a compiled stdio client/server round trip.
- `dist/`: generated JavaScript; never edit or commit it. Source imports intentionally use `.js` for Node ESM after compilation.

Tools: `brain_status`, `note_list`, `note_read`, `note_create`, `note_edit`, `attachment_create`, `brain_refresh`, `note_search`.

### Image attachments

`attachment_create` is separate from Markdown editing, available over HTTP and stdio
with the same client permissions. Pass `{ path, base64 }`, for example
`{ "path": "ai/attachments/photo.png", "base64": "<canonical padded base64>" }`.
No data URL, whitespace, remote URL fetching or local source-file path is accepted.

- PNG (`.png`), JPEG (`.jpg`/`.jpeg`), GIF (`.gif`) and WebP (`.webp`) only.
  Lowercase extension must match the binary signature; SVG, video and arbitrary
  extensions are rejected. Maximum decoded size is **1 MiB** (base64 input at most
  **1,398,104 characters**), within the existing HTTP request-body limit.
- Creation is strictly inside lowercase root-relative `ai/attachments/`, including
  existing subdirectories. An administrator must create that real writable directory
  beforehand; the tool cannot create directories. Traversal, hidden components,
  symlink parents and absolute paths are rejected. Publication uses the same
  descriptor-anchored, synced, atomic no-clobber path as note creation, mode `0600`.
  Existing files, symlinks and hardlinks are never replaced.
- Returns `path`, SHA-256 `hash`, `bytes`, `mimeType` and `committed: true`.
  Use `note_edit` separately to insert `![[ai/attachments/photo.png]]` into a note.
  Uploading does not modify any note or refresh the index: images are not listed,
  read, edited or indexed by the Markdown tools. There is no attachment overwrite,
  delete or binary retrieval tool. On an ambiguous I/O failure, publication may
  already have committed; retrying the same path cannot clobber it, but verification
  of an existing image requires external filesystem access.
- Validation identifies format signatures, **not** full image decodability, pixel
  dimensions, safe metadata or absence of malware. Files are not decoded, resized,
  stripped or re-encoded; embedded payloads/metadata can remain. External shell
  access and Obsidian rendering are outside MCP enforcement. No dependency added.

### Reversible defaults and limits

- One explicitly configured root; UTF-8, non-hidden `.md` files, max 1 MiB each. Symlinks and multi-link files cannot be read; directory symlinks are not traversed. No delete, move, or directory-management tools.
- **Creation only:** every MCP client (HTTP and stdio) can create new notes strictly inside lowercase root-relative `ai/`, including existing subdirectories. The parent directory must already exist; neither `ai/` nor subdirectories are created by note tools. `ai-other/`, `AI/`, absolute/traversal paths and symlink parents are rejected. Reading/searching and editing existing supported notes elsewhere remain allowed. This is enforced in the shared application creation path, not a client prompt or token scope.
- Note tools only publish `.md` notes; the separate `attachment_create` tool publishes the limited image formats described above. No tool uploads video, creates arbitrary file extensions or directories, or installs `node_modules`/code packages. Markdown content is unrestricted (including code, scripts or embedded data); existing directories named `node_modules` are not specially banned, and supported Markdown there remains accessible under the same rules. This is not content filtering or a sandbox for external shell/filesystem access. Internally the server does create temporary publication files and a root writer-lock directory, and maintains snapshot directories/database files in separate private state.
- **Shared Obsidian/Syncthing vault:** keep the whole vault mounted as the notes root and private state separate. No new environment, auth or Compose setting is needed for this policy. An administrator must ensure a real writable `ai/` directory (and `ai/attachments/` for image uploads, plus any desired subdirectories) exists in the vault before creation can work; the server does not provision it. Syncthing/external editors do not participate in the write queue/locks; the concurrent external-write limits below still apply.
- Markdown is authoritative. State must be outside the notes root (and not its ancestor), private to this process/user, and trusted. The state directory contains copies of note text as well as QMD's disposable database: treat both as sensitive, not backups.
- QMD SDK `2.8.3`, using `searchLex`/BM25 only. No bespoke search, vector database, automatic model downloads at runtime, or task orchestration. Dependency installation includes native packages and may fetch/build native runtimes.
- Refresh copies validated files into a disposable snapshot and calls QMD `update`. Runs synchronously after each successful Markdown write and before each search; no watcher or background queue. Refresh streams one file at a time rather than retaining the whole collection in memory. This full scan is intentionally a small-fixture default, not a vault-scale performance promise.
- Freshness is `pending`, `snapshot`, or `stale`. `snapshot` means a successful scan, **not** a transactionally consistent filesystem snapshot or proof against later external changes. External changes are not continuously monitored. Refresh failure leaves explicit stale status; a committed write stays committed, and cached search results may remain stale/partial.
- All operations use one serial queue, stronger than per-file serialization. Edits check the full-file SHA-256 inside that queue. Each old text must occur once in the original file; replacements cannot overlap. Creates publish with an atomic no-clobber link; edits use same-directory rename after syncing the temporary file. New/replaced files have mode `0600`.
- Exclusive root/state lock directories prevent multiple prototype instances from writing the same root. After a crash, manually remove `.brain-writer.lock` in the root and `writer.lock` in state **only after confirming no server is running**. Keep the root exclusive to this writer during edits: unrelated editors do not participate in the queue/locks, so concurrent external writes are not a cross-process compare-and-swap guarantee. No protection is claimed against privileged filesystem mutation/mount changes. I/O failure after publication can have an ambiguous acknowledgement; re-read before retrying.
- HTTP requires a valid `AUTH_CONFIG` file; there is no unauthenticated mode. Config changes require restart. Stdio retains its local OS-user/process trust boundary. No Pi deployment or vault integration has been performed. QMD dependency audit findings remain outstanding; see [research notes](docs/qmd-research.md).
- QMD currently declares a TypeScript `^5.9.3` peer dependency. pnpm reports the mismatch with TypeScript 7; our strict source/test type-check and integration suite pass with 7.0.2. `skipLibCheck` skips dependency declaration internals, not application type checking. No override silently hides that warning. pnpm may also offer QMD agent skills: they are not required or approved by this project.

## Resource limits and overload behaviour

Security-review fixes bound compact search output and admitted work. Defaults are deliberately conservative and reversible; they are **not** a Pi performance/capacity guarantee.

- Search titles are at most **256 UTF-16 code units**, excerpts **400**. `titleTruncated` identifies shortened titles; references are never shortened. Search data has a **32 KiB UTF-8 JSON budget**, with `resultsTruncated: true` when whole trailing hits are omitted. The MCP tool result, including both text and structured copies, has a **128 KiB safety ceiling** (JSON-RPC's request ID/envelope is separate). These are display limits only: authoritative Markdown is unchanged.
- One operation executes at a time. The pending-operation limit includes **running + waiting** work, for HTTP **and stdio**. Overflow is refused before admission with an MCP tool error (`Server busy…`); rejected writes are never queued to run later. HTTP additionally limits simultaneous requests, returning **503 + Retry-After: 1** without queuing overflow. Retry busy requests with backoff; for an ambiguous write failure/disconnect, re-read the file before retrying.
- HTTP slots include request-body reading and response backpressure. TCP connections and requests per socket are also bounded. `/health` bypasses the expensive-work admission gate (but still shares the TCP connection cap and Host/Origin checks). Body/socket inactivity limits are 30 seconds, header timeout 10 seconds; each socket handles at most 100 requests.
- Collection capacity is checked **inside the serialized operation before creating/replacing Markdown or creating images**. The shared write budget counts non-hidden Markdown throughout the root plus supported image extensions under `ai/attachments/`; unrelated existing vault images are not included. Images also count toward filesystem scan-entry limits. Budget failures leave files untouched. Refresh still indexes/checks Markdown only; external images exceeding upload budgets block subsequent writes, not Markdown search. External Markdown exceeding scan/count/byte budgets makes refresh explicitly `stale`; repair externally or raise the relevant limit and restart. Reads of known supported notes remain possible. Limits do not delete files.

Both entrypoints accept these validated positive-integer environment overrides (Markdown bytes are UTF-8 source bytes; image bytes are decoded binary bytes):

| Variable | Default | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_PENDING_OPERATIONS` | `8` | Running + waiting Brain operations |
| `MAX_HTTP_REQUESTS` | `8` | Simultaneous admitted HTTP MCP requests |
| `MAX_HTTP_CONNECTIONS` | `32` | TCP sockets, including idle/slow clients |
| `MAX_COLLECTION_FILES` | `10000` | Markdown files + supported images under `ai/attachments/` (pre-write) |
| `MAX_COLLECTION_BYTES` | `67108864` | Markdown source + those image bytes (64 MiB, pre-write) |
| `MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES` | `20000` | Files/directories encountered, including skipped/hidden entries |
| `MAX_SCAN_DEPTH` | `32` | Directory nesting below the root |

Paths are capped at 1024 UTF-8 bytes; each Markdown file remains capped at 1 MiB. Directory iteration is streamed and depth-bounded. `brain_status` reports configured limits and the running/waiting operation count. Environment changes require restart; Compose overrides belong under the service's `environment` section. Invalid limits prevent startup, and validated hard ceilings prevent accidentally disabling bounds with zero/infinity. Increase limits only after measuring actual memory/latency.

Local Compose additionally applies **768 MiB RAM (no extra swap), 1 CPU, 128 PIDs, a 64 MiB `/tmp` tmpfs, and a 384 MiB V8 old-space ceiling**. Shutdown grace is 60 seconds. These settings constrain the container, not Docker image/build size or persistent-volume disk usage. Preserve them when preparing future Traefik deployment configuration. Monitor cache/volume growth and use host quotas if a hard disk budget is needed; indexes remain disposable.

An already-started filesystem/QMD operation is **not** blindly cancelled on a request deadline or disconnect: it may still commit and must drain before shutdown. Native work can exceed the shutdown grace; forced termination/OOM can still require manual lock recovery. Counts/cgroups reduce availability risk, not eliminate DoS or establish an execution-time SLA. Dependency advisories and the TLS/private-network deployment prerequisites remain outstanding.

Regression tests reproduce million-character headings through real authenticated HTTP, check UTF-8/escaping byte budgets, saturate admission with real partial requests, verify disconnect recovery, reject queued/over-budget writes without publication, and check external-overflow stale recovery. The Docker test repeats the heading exploit and file budget under the actual cgroup limits, while retaining auth/revocation/index-rebuild checks.

## Adding authentication tokens

HTTP clients each need a token. **The client stores the original token; the application config stores only its SHA-256 hash.** All registered tokens share the same note policy: read/search and edit existing notes throughout the allowed root; create only inside lowercase root-relative `ai/`.

1. **Generate a token locally** and save it in that MCP client's private secret configuration:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

   Generate a different token per client. Do not paste tokens into chat, Git, URLs, or command-line arguments.

2. **Hash the token**, without echoing it or placing its value in shell history. Run from the project root using Bash:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   unset TOKEN
   read -rsp 'Paste client token: ' TOKEN; printf '\n'
   printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | node dist/src/token-hash.js
   unset TOKEN
   ```

   This prints only the hash. Keep the original token in the client, not on the server.

3. **Create the application's private config on first setup** (these commands preserve an existing config):

   ```sh
   mkdir -p .local/config
   chmod 700 .local/config
   [ -e .local/config/auth.json ] || cp config/auth.example.json .local/config/auth.json
   chmod 600 .local/config/auth.json
   ```

   Edit `.local/config/auth.json` and replace the placeholder with the hash printed above:

   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "tokens": [
       { "name": "my-agent", "sha256": "REPLACE_WITH_64_LOWERCASE_HEX_SHA256_HASH" }
     ]
   }
   ```

   For additional clients, **append another object to `tokens`**, preserving existing entries. Each name and hash must be unique. The placeholder is intentionally invalid: replace it before starting. Names use letters/numbers/underscores/hyphens, starting with a letter or number (maximum 64 characters).

   Compose mounts `.local/config` read-only at `/config` and sets `AUTH_CONFIG=/config/auth.json`. The container's UID/GID 1000 must be able to read it; adjust ownership/security labels if necessary. `.local/` is excluded from Git and Docker builds. For a non-Docker HTTP process, set `AUTH_CONFIG` to the absolute config-file path.

4. **Start the application, or restart it after changing tokens:**

   ```sh
   docker compose up --build -d   # first start / rebuild
   docker compose restart brain  # after editing an existing token config
   ```

   Config is read only at startup. **Adding/removing an entry has no effect until restart.** To revoke a client, remove its entry and restart; to rotate, add a fresh token, switch the client, then remove the old entry and restart again. Missing/invalid config prevents startup.

5. **Configure the client to send the original token on every MCP request:**

   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <original-token-not-the-hash>
   ```

   The client's exact configuration format varies; it must support custom authorization headers. Use HTTPS through Traefik for remote clients. Plain HTTP is only for local loopback testing or the private proxy-to-container hop. Stdio does not use these HTTP tokens; `/health` remains unauthenticated liveness only.

See [the authentication guide](docs/authentication.md) for configuration limits, rotation details, and a TypeScript client example.

## Local Docker / remote MCP transport

```sh
# First prepare .local/config/auth.json with your named token hashes:
# see docs/authentication.md (the example's placeholder is intentionally invalid).
# Builds/tests TypeScript in the image; starts fixture-only named volumes.
docker compose up --build -d
# Connect a Streamable HTTP MCP client WITH an Authorization: Bearer header to:
# http://127.0.0.1:8181/mcp
docker compose logs brain
docker compose down             # preserves fixture notes + disposable state

# Repeatable black-box test: build image, connect real MCP clients,
# exercise authentication/safe writes/QMD search, revoke a token, restart,
# erase cache, verify rebuild.
docker compose build
pnpm test:docker                # requires Docker; cleans up its own containers/volumes
```

The default `pnpm test` suite skips the Docker test unless `DOCKER_SMOKE=1` is set. The opt-in Docker test uses temporary, uniquely named volumes, checks writes independently on disk, and removes only those test resources. It was verified on Linux **amd64**, not Raspberry Pi ARM64. The image currently includes QMD's optional native/GPU packages (~1.6 GB locally); no semantic weights are downloaded. Image slimming/ARM64 verification remain follow-up work.

`compose.yaml` publishes **localhost only**, runs as UID/GID 1000, uses a read-only container filesystem, drops Linux capabilities, and keeps notes/cache in separate named volumes. Use only fixture volumes for now. A required private `.local/config` directory is mounted read-only for auth (hashes only). Bind-mounted directories need appropriate ownership and host security labels; do not mount the real vault without explicit approval. No Traefik, DNS, router, or Tailscale settings were modified.

HTTP settings (`pnpm dev:http` or `pnpm start:http` after building):

| Environment variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NOTES_ROOT`, `STATE_DIR` | Required disjoint Markdown root and disposable private state directory |
| `AUTH_CONFIG` | Required path to versioned hash-only token JSON; image defaults to `/config/auth.json`. Missing/invalid config prevents startup; loaded once, restart after edits. The old unauthenticated flag no longer enables access. |
| `HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` outside Docker; image defaults to `0.0.0.0` **inside** the container |
| `PORT` | Container/server port, default `3000` |
| `HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hostnames **without ports**; default `localhost,127.0.0.1,[::1]`. Add the future Traefik DNS name explicitly; keep loopback for health checks. Never derived from forwarded headers. |
| `HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Exact allowed browser origins; empty by default rejects all requests carrying `Origin`. Native MCP clients need no Origin. No permissive CORS is enabled. |

`POST /mcp` uses the official SDK's stateless Streamable HTTP with JSON responses, one SDK server/transport per request, and **one shared Brain/write queue**. There are no server-side MCP sessions, event replay, or long-lived GET/SSE streams (authenticated `GET`/`DELETE /mcp` return 405; unauthenticated `/mcp` requests return 401). `GET /health` is unauthenticated process liveness, not index freshness; use `brain_status` for freshness. Request bodies are capped at 4 MiB, with 30-second request-body/10-second header timeouts. SIGTERM stops admission, drains active requests, and releases root/state locks. Abrupt termination still requires manual lock recovery.

For future Traefik integration, use the existing `websecure` / `myresolver` label convention and an internal port of `3000`, with **no published application port**. Traefik would preserve Host for e.g. `brain.rpi.${DOMAIN}` and terminate TLS. That deployment configuration is not applied here. Named-token authentication is implemented, not OAuth; private DNS alone is not access control.

## Implementation handoff

Inspect upstream QMD documentation and package APIs first. Prefer a thin adapter over QMD internals or a second search implementation. Build a small tested vertical slice, document assumptions and setup, and report material decisions needing user input. Use fixtures, not the user's actual vault; do not deploy, publish, create remote repositories, or change Tailscale configuration without permission.
